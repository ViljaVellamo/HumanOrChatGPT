This project was inspired by the widely publicised article “AI-generated poetry is indistinguishable from human-written poetry and is rated more favorably” (Porter & Machery 2024). In that study, the participants were shown ten poems, five of which were written by poets and five generated with ChatGPT. After that, they had to guess whether the poems were written by humans or ChatGPT. In this program, the users are shown more poems, and the user can also see the results after every poem if they wish. The project is made primarily for fun, but also to spark thoughts on whether ChatGPT has a “style” that one can learn to recognise (Walsh 2024).

When showing poems, the program alternates at random between two corpora: the “poet corpus” (Table 1) and the “ChatGPT corpus” (Table 2). All of the poems in the poet corpus are public domain, fetched from either Project Gutenberg or its Nordic counterpart Projekt Runeberg. The choice of poems is somewhat limited by what is available on these platforms. There are 1–10 poems by each author in the poet corpus: 70 poems in English, 50 poems in Finnish and 40 poems in Norwegian (or Dano-Norwegian).

Along the lines of the paper by Porter & Machery, the corpus of ChatGPT-generated poems are made by a simple prompt “Can you write a poem in the style of x, please” (or “Voitko kirjoittaa runon x:n tyyliin, kiitos” or “Kan du skrive et dikt i stil med x, takk”) where x represents each poet whose poems are in the poet corpus. There is an equivalent number of poems in each poet’s “style” generated in this way in the ChatGPT corpus. Poems have been generated between 9th and 24th of February 2025 using the free version of ChatGPT.

The poems in the poet corpus are stripped from their creative ways of using spacing, because otherwise the results would be immediately obvious – ChatGPT seems to never add spacing before a new line, for example. In this way, the cards are stacked against the poets to make the game playable at all. This is one of the problems with these kinds of tests, as has been pointed out (Crockett 2025).

I hope this project can evoke thoughts on whether it is meaningful to use these kinds of tests to compare human and LLM-writing. Encountering poetry in this way is obviously very removed from an organic reading experience. What is missing? What other questions do we need to be asking?
